# Data-Structures
Basic Implementation of Some Data Structures In Java for Quick Implementation wherever required.

# Graph :
  There is basic implementation og graph using HashMap and List in Java alongwith BFS and DFS algorithms for traversal of graphs in list. The Minimum Spanning Tree Algorithms like Prim's and Kruskals Are Also Implemented. Graph Using HashMap is Using Generics for implementation.
